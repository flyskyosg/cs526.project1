SAMPLE REFERENCE CSV

The data in the CTA L stops CSV is provided as a reference to help you build your app.

The May 2012 cta_L_stops.csv contains the latest, normal list of stations.

The May 2013 cta_L_stops_rls.csv is a file flags stops served by the Red Line during the Red Line South Reconstruction, when Red Line South stations from Cermak-Chinatown to 95th/Dan Ryan (inclusive) will be closed, and Red Line trains rerouted to the elevated South Side 'L' through Ashland/63rd, sharing track with Green Line trains to Garfield.



You may include this information in your app, but note that the data and/or location for this information may change as we further develop the API. You should periodically retrieve a new version of this information via the CTA Developer Center Train Tracker API Documentation and include it in your app rather than referencing the source location from which you downloaded this file directly.
