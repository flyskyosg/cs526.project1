{"name":"Somebody's Watching Me","tagline":"a python module using omegalib and osgearth to view crime data of Chicago","body":"# Features and Usage\r\n\r\n##### all features and usages are for running this app on [CAVE2](http://www.evl.uic.edu/core.php?mod=4&type=1&indi=424) if not noticed otherwise\r\n\r\n## Start\r\n* Once the app is running, there will be a female voice telling you 'waiting for loading data'\r\n* Once the app is loaded, you will be flying from far away to Chicago (animation)\r\n\r\n## The Environment\r\nAt first you would see:\r\n* CTA 'L' Lines in their corresponding colors\r\n* CTA 'L' Stops and their names, except some in Loop\r\n* name of communities followed by number of crimes in that community\r\n* All types of crimes in 2013\r\n* real time feeds of CTA trains (the higher side is where they are heading) \r\n\r\n## Navigation\r\n* Use the wand to navigate. Keep **Button7** down and move the wand. The camera will transform exactly as your wand moves (translation and rotation). **Note:** try to move wand slowly at first\r\n* If you lost yourself, press **Button5** to reset the scene\r\n* If you are on your laptop, I also implemented navigation, see source code for reference\r\n\r\n## Change Background\r\n* As long as the menu is not opened, you can press **ButtonLeft** to change maps in a cycle\r\n* I currently have four maps: mapquestaerial, openstreetmap, yahoo_aerial, and yahoo_map\r\n\r\n## Watch A Community Area\r\n* There are 77 communities in Chicago. Use 'Menu->Chicago Panel->WATCH A COMMUNITY' to fly to a particular community area\r\n* There might be short pause before the camera actually moves. This is because the app is drawing boundary for the community\r\n* You will be hearing a female voice responding you while camera moves\r\n\r\n## Real Time Simulation\r\n* Use 'Menu->Chicago Panel->REAL TIME WATCH' to enter or quit simulation mode\r\n* Once you are in simulation mode, use **Button2** to start the simulation. You will see a timer on the center top of the screen\r\n* When the simulation is running, press **Button3** once will pause it, press **Button3** again will stop it\r\n\r\n## Filter Crime Data\r\n* You can use 'Menu->Chicago Panel->FILTER CRIME TYPES/YEARS' to filter crime data shown in the environment\r\n* If **All** is selected, you will not be able to uncheck certain year, please uncheck **All** first\r\n* If you uncheck **All**, it will go back to the status before you checked **All**\r\n\r\n## Analyze Crime Data\r\n* You can also check statistical data of crimes in Chicago by 'Menu->Chicago Panel->MORE INFO'\r\n* Currently there are three options: hour of day, day of week, season of year\r\n* hour of day: you will see four bars in each community area, representing number of crimes in 12am-6am, 6am-12pm, 12pm-6pm and 6pm-12am respectively\r\n* day of week: you will see seven bars, representing seven days in a week starting from Sunday\r\n* season of year: you will see four bars. They are Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep and Oct-Dec\r\n* If the number is greater than 80% of the maximum number, the bar will be red\r\n* If the number is between 60% and 80% of the maximum number, the bar will be orange\r\n* If the number is between 40% and 60% of the maximum number, the bar will be yellow\r\n* If the number is between 20% and 40% of the maximum number, the bar will be green\r\n* If the number is lower than 20% of the maximum number, the bar will be white","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
